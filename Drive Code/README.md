Information on the different Drivetrain configurations can be found on the wiki, at https://github.com/ColdLogic3617/ExampleFRC/wiki/Chassis-&-Drivetrain-Configurations




Differential Drive - two motors on either side of the robot are connected by a gearbox. They turn opposite directions to spin the axel that turns the wheels.

Direct Drive - motors are connected directly to the wheels or to individual gearboxes that connect to the wheels (i.e. one motor per wheel).

Killough Drive - the robot is either triangle or circle shaped and uses two contact point in the front to move forward and backwards, and has a third wheel in back for rotation.

Mecanum Drive - utilizes mecanum wheels which have rollers that allow for swerving motions (the ability to move in any direction without actually turning the robot).
