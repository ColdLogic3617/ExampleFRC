Differential Drive - two motors on either side of the robot are connected by a gearbox. They turn opposite directions to spin the axel that turns the wheels.

Arcade Drive (also called "West Coast Drive") - the robot utilizes a single joystick as a drive controller. The y-axis of the joystick represents the forward/backward motion and the x-axis represents the robots rotation.

Tank Drive - the robot uses two joysticks as drive controllers. One joystick's y-axis represents the the forward/backward motion of the left side of the drivetrain, the other joystick's y-axis represents the right side. To turn, one joystick must be pushed forward and the other pulled back.
