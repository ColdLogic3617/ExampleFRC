Cartesian Drive - ySpeed - The robot's speed along the Y axis [-1.0..1.0]. Right is positive. xSpeed - The robot's speed along the X axis [-1.0..1.0]. Forward is positive. zRotation - The robot's rotation rate around the Z axis [-1.0..1.0]. Clockwise is positive.

Polar Drive - magnitude - The robot's speed at a given angle [-1.0..1.0]. Forward is positive. angle - The angle around the Z axis at which the robot drives in degrees [-180..180]. zRotation - The robot's rotation rate around the Z axis [-1.0..1.0]. Clockwise is positive.
